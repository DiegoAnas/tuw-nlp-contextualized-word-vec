# **192.039 Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing 2024W - Final Project**

## **Overview**
This work is an extension of the paper _Learned in Translation: Contextualized Word Vectors_ with improvements using **BERT-based embeddings**.
âš  **Note:** The BERT-based embedding integration is still a **work in progress** and may not be fully functional yet. Further debugging and testing are required to ensure stability.

## **Installation**
### **Requirements**
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install torch transformers BERTembedding datasets
```

## **Next Steps**
- Debug and stabilize BERT-based embeddings in BCN.
- Experiment with different BERT variants (`bert-large`, `roberta-base`).
- Fine-tune BERT layers for **domain-specific tasks**.
